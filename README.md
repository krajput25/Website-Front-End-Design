This is my first attempt at writing code for a beginner level website. I've been teaching myslef core concepts of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and related frameworks, JSON, SQL,etc. 
Hoping to get direction from anybody who wishes to help. I'm trying to make a fully functional website and also understand how the data interchange between the client and the server 
takes place and how I am supposed to use the languages that I have been learning, for this. Some of the files may be raw and I will be uploading the latest updates on them as and when I amke any.
